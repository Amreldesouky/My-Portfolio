## How to Use and Customize

1.  **Download Files:** Download all files from this repository/archive.
2.  **Customize Content:**
    *   Open `index.html` and modify the placeholder text:
        *   AI Engineer Name (in navbar, home section, footer).
        *   Job title/description in the home section.
        *   Experience details (Job Title, Company, Dates, Description).
        *   Certification details (Certificate Name, Issuer, Link if available).
        *   Project details (Project Title, Description, Image/Video source, Code link).
        *   Contact links (Email, LinkedIn, etc.).
    *   Replace the placeholder images in the `img/` folder with your own:
        *   `profile_placeholder.png` (Should be square; CSS makes it circular).
        *   `project1_placeholder.png`, `project2_placeholder.png`, etc.
    *   (Optional) Modify styles in `css/style.css` to change colors, fonts, or other layouts.
    *   (Optional) Adjust behavior in `js/script.js` if needed (e.g., form submission logic).
3.  **Deploy to GitHub Pages:**
    *   Create a new repository on GitHub.
    *   Upload all files and folders (`index.html`, `css/`, `js/`, `img/`, `README.md`) to the repository.
    *   Go to the repository's Settings.
    *   Navigate to the Pages section.
    *   Choose the main branch (usually `main` or `master`) as the source.
    *   Save the settings. Your site will be deployed to a URL like `https://your-username.github.io/your-repository-name/`.
